## Something about Isometric Projection -- Placing the dots from the map

[How Isometric Coordinates Work in 2D Games (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04oQ2jOUjkU)


## Connecting the dots

Must use an algorithm. Some options are:

- DDA (Digital Differentia Analyzer) Algorithm 
- Linear Interpolation
- Bresenham's line algorithm
